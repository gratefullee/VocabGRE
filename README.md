# VocabGRE

I've been looking for a suitable GRE vocab learning product for myself, but I didn't really like any.
So I just made one for fun. It's nothing majestic but I just wanted to share. English is not my native language, so I tend to put extra work. I believe there are many people like me out there!

It has a few functions for the vocabulary learning.
1) You can decide the number of the words you want. I was able to find online flashcards with the whole 995 words on the Internet but I couldn't set up the number of the words. 
2) You can choose if you want to shuffle the words or not.
3) You can also take a spelling test. It's very important to know how to spell the words, not simply to know the meanings. You should know how/when to use the advanced vocabulary. 

To use it, 

1) Download [Manhattan GRE 1000 Vocab list as a PDF file](https://corporate.lowes.com/sites/lowes-corp/files/2020-01/manhattan_prep_1000_gre_words_.pdf). 
2) Rename the file as 'manhattan1000.pdf' 
3) run pip install PyMuPDF==1.18.15 on cmd. 
4) run the python file. Keep learning! 
(Every file has to be in the same directory!)
